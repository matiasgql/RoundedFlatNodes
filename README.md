# Rounded Flat Nodes

A minimalist style for Unreal Engine graph nodes. This plugin add a simplified visual appearance, flatter, that makes graphs clearer and more readable.

There is no impact on the performance and stability of the engine, only the visual aspect of the UI is changed : just some super tiny .png files used by Slate are replaced.

Only UE5.4+ because of the SVG Brush support on UMG Maybe I will add Image Brush support for UE5.3 and backwards.

### Note:

This is a fork that adds rounded corners based on [Flat Nodes](https://github.com/brumenn/FlatNodes).
